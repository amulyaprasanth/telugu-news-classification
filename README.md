# Telugu News Article Classification Using Natural Language Processing

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on classifying Telugu newspaper articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques implemented in TensorFlow. The goal is to accurately categorize news articles into predefined classes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/telugu-nlp?select=telugu_news).

## Evaluation Metric
The performance of the classification models is evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.

## Models Explored
In this project, I experimented with several models for text classification, including:
- Naive Bayes
- FeedForward Neural Network
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Bidirectional GRU

After thorough experimentation, the GRU model emerged as the best performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of **93.69%**!

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various NLP techniques in classifying Telugu news articles, with the GRU model providing the highest accuracy among the models tested. 

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to further improvements!
