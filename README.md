# Telugu News Article Classification Using Natural Language Processing

**Problem Statement:** In this notebook, I tried to classify news paper articles using Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow

* **Data:** The data is taken from Kaggle datasets. You can find the data [here]('https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/telugu-nlp?select=telugu_news').

* **Evaluation:** We used accuracy to evaluate the model

I've tried various models for text classification like
* Naive Bayes model
* FeedForward Neural Network
* LSTM
* GRU
* Bidirectional GRU

and found that GRU model performs better with accuracy of ***93.69%*** accuracy!!!!
